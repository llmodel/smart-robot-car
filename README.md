# Smart Robot Car Public Repo
This repo contains code developed for Elegoo Smart Robot Car v4.0 hardware platform.

## kbd_drive/kbd_drive.py
This is a python code that will interface with the built-in WiFi network socket to control the robot-car using the remote computer keyboard. It handles the heartbeat replies, so it works with the stock robot-car firmware without any modification.
